**Python Scripts in VS Code**
Python scripts, or `.py` files, are the backbone of application development and automation. They're crucial for building robust and scalable projects.

---

**Running and Managing Python Scripts**
- **Script Basics**: We'll cover how to open, create, and execute scripts in VS Code, providing a foundation for script-based development.
- **Efficient Script Execution**: Discover tools such as code linting, debugging, and the use of virtual environments to manage your projects effectively.
- **Integrated Terminal Usage**: Learn how to leverage the integrated terminal in VS Code to run your scripts (`python filename.py`), streamlining your workflow.

**Python Projects and Virtual Environments**
   - Tools to discuss:
     - Pip
     - Virtual Environments (venv)
     - Conda
     - Poetry
   
   - **Pip** is a package manager for Python. It allows you to install, uninstall, and update packages from the Python Package Index (PyPI).
    - **Pip Concepts**:
      - **Installing Packages**: We'll cover how to install packages using `pip` in the terminal.
      - **Bulk Installation**: We'll cover how to install multiple packages at once using `pip` in the terminal along with a `requirements.txt` file.
      - **Uninstalling Packages**: We'll cover how to uninstall packages using `pip` in the terminal.
      - **Updating Packages**: We'll cover how to update packages using `pip` in the terminal.
   
   - **Conda** is a Python package and environment manager. It allows you to create new environments, install packages, and manage dependencies.
    - **Conda Concepts**:
      - **Creating New Environments**: We'll cover how to create new environments using `conda` in the terminal.
      - **Activating Environments**: We'll cover how to activate environments using `conda` in the terminal.
      - **Deactivating Environments**: We'll cover how to deactivate environments using `conda` in the terminal.
      - **Deleting Environments**: We'll cover how to delete environments using `conda` in the terminal.
      - **Installing Packages**: We'll cover how to install packages using `conda` in the terminal.
      - **Bulk Installation**: We'll cover how to install multiple packages at once using `conda` in the terminal along with a `requirements.txt` file.
      - **Uninstalling Packages**: We'll cover how to uninstall packages using `conda` in the terminal.
      - **Updating Packages**: We'll cover how to update packages using `conda` in the terminal.
    
   - **Virtual Environments (venv)** are isolated Python environments (Meaning has it's own python interpreter and package library) that allow you to install packages and manage dependencies for individual projects. They are useful for ensuring that your projects have the correct dependencies and versions.
    - **Virtual Environment Concepts**:

**General Q&A and Troubleshooting Session**
Here are five common questions and their answers related to the topics covered in this lecture:

1. **Q: How do I set up Python virtual environments in VS Code?**
   A: You can set up virtual environments using the command palette (`Ctrl+Shift+P`) and typing "Python: Select Interpreter". Then, choose the interpreter from your virtual environment.

2. **Q: My Python script runs in the terminal but not VS Code. What could be wrong?**
   A: Check if the correct Python interpreter is selected in VS Code. Also, ensure that all required modules are installed within the environment that VS Code uses.

3. **Q: How do I convert a Python script into a Jupyter Notebook in VS Code?**
   A: You can convert Python scripts to notebooks using the `#%%` comment line to define cells and then using the command "Export Current Python File as Jupyter Notebook".

4. **Q: Why can't I see syntax highlighting or IntelliSense suggestions in my Python file?**
   A: This issue might occur if the Python extension needs to be installed or activated. Ensure that the Python extension is installed and the correct interpreter is selected.

5. **Q: How can I share my Jupyter notebook with someone who doesn't have VS Code?**
   A: Jupyter notebooks in `.ipynb` format can be shared directly as they are widely supported. Alternatively, you can export the notebook to HTML or PDF format for easy sharing.
